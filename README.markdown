Why Stackless?  An Introduction to Concurrent Programming with Stackless Python
===============================================================================

This contains the reStructuredText source for my introduction to
stackless python.  If you're just interested in reading the tutorial,
pdf and html versions are available on [my
website](http://www.grant-olson.net/projects/1970/01/02/introduction-to-stackless-python.html).

If you're actually interested in updating examples, typos, the version
of python used, check out the code and build the final documents with:

./build.sh

There is also a build.bat file for windows, but it's somewhat out of
date until I manage to get a windows box setup.
