--------------
Enter Dataflow
--------------

If you're familiar with unix systems, you've probably used dataflow techniques
whether you knew it or not.  Take the following shell command::

    cat README | more

In fairness, the Windows equivilent is::

    type readme.txt | more

Although dataflow techniques aren't as pervasive in the Windows world as they
are in the Unix world.

For those who are unfamilar with the *more* program, it recieves input from an
external source, displays a page's worth of output, pauses until the user hits
a key, and shows another page.  The '|' operator takes the output from one
program, and pipes it into the input of another command.  In this case, either
*cat* or *type* sends the text of a document to standard output, and *more*
recieves it.

The *more* program just sits there until data flows into it from another
program.  Once enough data flows in, it displays a page on the screen and
pauses.  The user hits a key, and more lets more data flow in.  Hence the term
*dataflow*.
